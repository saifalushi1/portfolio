    "bio": "Hello my name is Saif Alushi! I am a junior Software Engineer who loves headaches... I mean problem sovling! My first introduction to programming was right before I started college and I asked my friend for an old textbook of his from any CS class and I taught my self C++. From there I went on to pursue my associates in computer science and work in sales. During my time at Uber I realized I looked forward to the end of the day so I could start coding. So I quit my job and attended General Assembly's software engineering bootcamp.",
