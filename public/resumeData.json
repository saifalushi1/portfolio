    "bio": "Hello my name is Saif Alushi! I am a Jr. Software Engineer who loves headaches... I mean building cool software! My first introduction to programming was right before I began college. I got started by teaching myself C++ from a friends old college textbook and went on to build my first snake game. From there I went on to pursue my associates in computer science and work in sales/client-facing roles. I later put college on hold and started at Uber for business as a SMB consultant! During my time at Uber I realized I was looking forward to the end of the day so I could start building web apps more so than my actual work. So I quit my job and finished my studies at GA.",
